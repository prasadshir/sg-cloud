# Reporting and Registry

Once you have passed your Acquia Certified Cloud Pro exam, you can shout it from the rooftops by adding your Acquia Certified badge in your CV, email signature, and LinkedIn profile.

You can confirm you are registered in Acquiaâ€™s Certification Registry by visiting [https://certification.acquia.com/registry](https://certification.acquia.com/registry) and searching for your name. It may take a week or so for your name to appear after passing your exam.

## Additional Resources

The following are additional resources provided for your supplemental learning and practice.

**Acquia Cloud infrastructure**

The [Acquia Cloud architecture and key concepts](https://docs.acquia.com/acquia-cloud/arch) section of the Acquia Cloud documentation describes how Acquia Cloud works, including information about Acquia Cloud's architecture, security, high availability features, and compliance with standards and regulations.

As indicated in the two diagrams below, there are four main components for both Acquia Cloud Enterprise and Acquia Cloud Professional applications:

* _Reverse proxy caching and load balancing servers_ - Varnish/nginx
* _Web servers_ - Apache with PHP and Drupal code
* _Database servers_ - MySQL \(Percona\)
* _Network file system_ - \(GlusterFS\)

The exact configuration of an Acquia Cloud application's infrastructure depends on several factors, including whether the application is part of Acquia Cloud Enterprise or Acquia Cloud Professional.

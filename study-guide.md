## Additional Resources

The following are additional resources provided for your supplemental learning and practice.

**Cloud Platform infrastructure**

The [Cloud Platform architecture and key concepts](https://docs.acquia.com/cloud-platform/arch/) section of the Cloud Platform documentation describes how Cloud Platform works, including information about Cloud Platform's architecture, security, high availability features, and compliance with standards and regulations.

As indicated in the two diagrams below, there are four main components for both Cloud Platform Enterprise and Cloud Platform Professional applications:

* _Reverse proxy caching and load balancing servers_ - Varnish/nginx
* _Web servers_ - Apache with PHP and Drupal code
* _Database servers_ - MySQL \(Percona\)
* _Network file system_ - \(GlusterFS\)

The exact configuration of an Cloud Platform application's infrastructure depends on several factors, including whether the application is part of Cloud Platform Enterprise or Cloud Platform Professional.

**Cloud Platform Enterprise infrastructure diagram**

Here is a diagram of an Cloud Platform Enterprise application and how the components interact with one another for different user profiles:![](.gitbook/assets/ACE_infrastructure_diagram.png) ****

**Cloud Platform Professional infrastructure diagram**

As a comparison, the following is an example of an Cloud Platform Professional application, and its component interactions:![](.gitbook/assets/ACP_infrastructure_diagram.png)

**Acquia Site Factory infrastructure diagram**

The [Acquia Site Factory](https://docs.acquia.com/site-factory/) and Cloud Platform section of the Cloud Platform documentation describes the supported and included features of Acquia Site Factory, which is built upon Cloud Platform Enterprise.

The following diagram describes the infrastructure used for the Cloud Platform Site Factory application, and how its components interact with one another:![](.gitbook/assets/ACSF_infrastructure_diagram.png)
